# SGPA Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic SGPA Calculator in java swing. An SGPA (Semester Credit Grade Point Average) calculator is a tool used by students and educational institutions to calculate a student's average GPA for a specific semester or academic term. Here's an overview of how an SGPA calculator typically works:

## Features

- Semester GPA
- Pass/Fail Option

## Dependencies

## Acknowledgments
As of our last knowledge update in September 2023, there isn't a specific or universally recognized "SGPA calculator" that is distinct from a standard GPA calculator. A GPA (Grade Point Average) calculator is a tool used to calculate a student's overall GPA or a GPA for a specific semester or term. It can be used for both CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and SGPA calculations.

Gather information about the courses you took during a specific semester or term. You'll need details for each course, including the course name or code, the number of credit hours for each course, and the grade received.

Know the grading scale used by your institution. Different institutions may have different scales, such as A+ to F or numerical scales. Each grade is associated with a specific grade point value.

In creating this version of SGPA Calculator, I hope to pay homage to the origins of this beloved while introducing it to a new generation. It is with deep respect for the past and enthusiasm for the future that I share this creation.

Since my knowledge is based on information available up to September 2023, we recommend checking with your educational institution or using an updated GPA calculator designed for your specific institution's grading system and policies for the most accurate GPA calculations.

Thank you to the countless individuals who have cherished and perpetuated SGPA Calculator, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of its ongoing legacy.

With appreciation,
